facade Application XSLT Transformation
======================================

facade is an XSLT language definition and template engine used
to define UI elements from XML and transform them to UI views.

A use case of a facade template would be to create a UI  definition
and render that definition to a web page, or an awt window for example.

The expectation is that the end result of a transformation is renderable
by a library specific to the UI being generated.
